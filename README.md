# ML Tutorials
This repository contains various tutorials presented by Ania at various occasions.

1. Tutorials accompanying Ania's lectures at [2025 Winter School on "Physics of Machine Learning &amp; Machine Learning for Physics"](https://indico.fysik.su.se/event/8856/).

- `Memorization_vs_generalization_vs_Hessian.ipynb` - <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Shmoo137/ML-Tutorials/blob/main/Memorization_vs_generalization_vs_Hessian.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a> - A Colab Notebook to explore the memorization, bad and good generalization and does the Hessian see the difference?

- `Explaining_with_CAM.ipynb` - <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Shmoo137/ML-Tutorials/blob/main/Explaining_with_CAM.ipynb">

</a> - A Colab Notebook to play with class activation method (CAM), a local model-dependent explanation technique.

2. Tutorial presented as a part of ["AI for Physicists"](https://www.eliskagreplova.com/ai-for-physicists-ap3751) course in May 2025, invited by Prof. Eliška Greplová.
